Deep Q-Network (DQN) for solving the Cart Pole environment in gym

The task of this project is to implement a Deep Q-Network (DQN) for solving the Cart Pole environment in gym. You are required to implement and train a Q-Network using Pytorch, and solve the environment. You are also going to use an experience replay memory to store and sample experiences
for training the DQN. Broadly, the project emcompasses the following tasks:
1. Neural Network using Pytorch: Build a Neural Network using Pytorch to approximate Q
values from a state.
2. Training the DQN using Pytorch: Train the DQN by implementing a target Q network
which generates the training targets, and stores it in an experience replay buffer.
